## Why Documentation

less cognitive overhead

It is impractical and inefficient to rely on code alone as the source of documentation.

Presenter notes

# Know your Audience

## Users

- allows people to code more efficiently and effectively when they can know how a module
- works. How to use it' features


## Contributor

- Promotes adoption and encourages use
- Reduces the burden of answering the same question.


It's important to understand who or what you are writing documentation for.

# Before you document

Before you care about documentation, care about code quality.

- naming: method signatures, names, param names, number of
- Complexity of method
- Use patterns: SRP, DRY
- Use syntax to help with verbosity

**Why**

When it comes down to nutes and bolts, the code we write is the ultimate source of truth, not the documentation.

- (If) we might not write documentation.
    (note) that means we have to rely on the coee

If you have to, try Document Driven Development (DDD)
  (note) explain what DDD is. it's just like TDD
  - this will help you to understand what you are trying to do before you write a single line of code
  - Try Test Driven Development (TDD)
  - Review with yoru peers
- Don't document the implementation
  - Explain the what, not the how.
When you make a change to a function, don't forget to update the documentation

# Types of documentation

1. single-line (inline) the comment should only relate to the exact line it's written on
1. multi-line (block) explain a section of code.

An alternative to the block comment borrowed from javadoc-style comments is starting the comment
with a double asterisk, `/** content */`

# Writing Effective Documentation





- reference jira tickets, confluence (use pageId)
- Use TODO and FIXME annotations. When possible, create jira tickets for them following the
  structure:
  - why
  - how
  - ideas, suggestions, meetings, participants, recommendations
  the more information the better
