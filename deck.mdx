# Why write documentation?

<div style={{color: "#ddd", fontSize: 40, textAlign: "left"}}>
  <ol>
    <Appear>
      <li>Requires less cognitive overhead than reading code</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Multiple mediums to understand a system.</li>
          </ul>
      <li>It is inefficient to rely on codebase as the only
        source for documentation</li>
      <li>Write code <em style={{color: "gold"}}>*more efficiently</em></li>
          <em>* when done right and is up to date!</em>
      <li>Use software to it's fullest potential</li>
      <li>Single source of truth -- minimize duplication</li>
      <li>Document <em style={{color: "gold"}}>why</em> a decision was made</li>
      <li>Reduces the burden of answering the same question again and again...</li>
    </Appear>
  </ol>
</div>

```notes
mediums/channels: code, html, playgounds, gitbook

Single source of truth
- Standards (confluence)
- linting, formatting

Why a decision was made
- Standards on use (confluence)

answering the same question
- how to make a code commits
- Troubleshooting isntallation or startup
- Setting up artifactory as the internal npm registry
```

# Before you document...

<Appear>
  <h2>Know your Audience</h2>
</Appear>

```notes
Who are you writing documentation for?
- It's fine if it's for yourself -- often a great way to learn if you can explain it.
```

---

### Users

<Appear>
  <p><strong>How do I use this?</strong></p>
</Appear>

```notes
Users, typically, care about only one thing...

If I pull down entrance-ramp... how do i use it.

Effective documentation allows users to code more efficiently and effectively when they
can know how a module works.
```
---

### Contributor

- How to setup & configure
- How to test
- How it works --  internals
- Technologies used
- Standards & styleguides
- How to update -- new features, bug fixes, commits, pull-requests

```notes
internals
- ajax -- is it returning a Promise, Observable, Generator, does it expect a callback

tech used
- tck stack: react + redux + Rxjs + i18next
```

---

It's _very_ important to understand who or what you are writing documentation for.

---

# Before you document...

<Appear>
  <h2>care about code quality!</h2>
</Appear>

---

# Code Quality Means...

- Naming: variables, function/method signatures, function parameters
- Use patterns that simplify your API:
  - Single Responsibility
  - Don't Repeat Yourself
  - Encapsulate the Concept that Varies
- Use syntax to help reduce verbosity
- Write in a declarative-style

```notes
- lambda functions are less verbose than declared functions.
  - 1 line vs 3 lines

- anonymous functions don't require a function name -- double edged-sword

- write in a declarative-style rather than imperative
  - That is, iterators over for loops.
```
---

At the end of the day, we build software not documentation.

```notes
Documentation takes time.
- sometimes we don't (given) have time to write documentation.

Internally speaking,
- We must rely on well-written code far more often than we can documentation
```

# Document Driven Development (DDD)

Similar to Test Driven Development (TDD) but with documentation!

  > \[1\] _"The philosophy behind Documentation-Driven Development is a simple:
  from the perspective of a user, if a feature is not documented, then it
  doesn't exist, and if a feature is documented incorrectly, then it's broken."_

- Document the feature _first_; if it's not documented, it doesn't exist
  - This will help you to understand _what_ you are trying to do _before_ you write a single line of code
- Unit tests should be written that test the features as described by the documentation
- When possible, documentation should be reviewed by users before any
development
- When a feature is being modified, it should be modified documentation-first
- When features change, so do the tests.

When you make a change _remember to update the documentation!_

explain what DDD is. it's just like TDD

# The many types of documentation

- **Internal**
  - private
  - code comments / how things work under the hood

- **External**
  - Public-facing / open to the public
  - Exposed functionality

- **Playgrounds**
  - react components: storybook, MDX,
  - REPLs, codepens, etc
  - examples, tutorials

---

# Syntax

1. single-line (inline) the comment should only relate to the exact line it's written on
  ```js
  `// single-line comment also referred to as an "inline"
  ```
1. multi-line (block) explains a section of code.
  ```js
  /*
   * multi-line also referred to as a "block"
   */
  ```

An alternative to the block comment borrowed from javadoc-style comments is starting the comment
with a double asterisk `/** content */`. eg

  ```js
  /**
   * jsdoc-styled comments
   */
  ```


```notes
Multi-line for
- javascript documentation parser / jsdoc
```

# Writing Effective Documentation

- Be brief
  - Summaries are good
  - Bullet points are great
- Point to Referencees
  - Internal code,
  - Jira tickets,
  - External docmentation: \<my-lib\>.com, MDN, Confluence _(use pageId)_
  - Pull Request comments _(click on the datetime to get the id)_
- Use `TODO` and `FIXME` marker.
  - When able, create Jira tickets for these.<br/>
  Either way, document the _reason_ for the marker.

If you find it useful, use comment markers (`*, !, ?, TODO, FIXME`)

```notes
- Use `TODO` and `FIXME` marker.
  - Using "what" and "why" is usually a good place to start.
  - how: ideas or suggestions are helpful
  Generally, the more information the better
```
